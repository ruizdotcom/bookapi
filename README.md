## Planning Story

During the planning I started by making a wireframe to get the general idea of what I wanted my project to look like and an erd to understand the relationships between things. 

### Technologies Used

- Javascript

### Unsolved Problems

- Still need to reset all the forms
- Would like to eventually add a comment section for each book
